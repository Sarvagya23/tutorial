In order to connect worker node to master node we can use the below command on the worker node


A. Command to be executed on master node to see the node-token and send to the worker node

# Outputs the toekn value on the terminal to look.
1. cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token

#The scp command is used to securely transfer files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts over a Secure Shell (SSH) connection.
This command transfers the token from the master node to a destination on the local worker node from where we can copy the token and use it in the next curl command.
2. scp /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token <username of worker node>@<worker-node-ip-address>:<destination_folder>

B. Command to be executed on the worker node

#curl is used to download the script from https://get.k3s.io, ensuring silent and fail-safe behavior. 
The INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START environment variable is set to true, which instructs the script to skip starting the K3s service after installation. 
The K3S_URL environment variable is set to the specified URL (https:///<master-node-ip-address>:6443) to determine where the K3s server should be accessed. 
The K3S_TOKEN environment variable is set to a specific token value, which serves as authentication for joining a node to the K3s cluster.
1. curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | \
    INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_START=true \
    K3S_URL=https://<master-node-ip-address>:6443 \
 K3S_TOKEN=<token obtained from the master node> \
    sh -s - \
    --node-label "cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator=$(curl -fs "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/gpu-platform" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google")"
